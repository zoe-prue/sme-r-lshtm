^Case control study of risk factors for infant deaths from diarrhoea^

An attempt was made to ascertain all infant deaths from diarrhoea occurring
over a one year period in two cities in southern Brazil, by means of weekly
visits to all hospitals, coroners' services and death registries in the
cities.

Whenever the underlying cause of death was considered to be diarrhoea, a
physician visited the parents or guardians to collect further information
about the terminal illness, and data on possible risk factors. The same
data were collected for 2 control infants. Those chosen were the nearest
neighbour aged less than 1 year, and the next child in the neighbourhood
aged less than 6 months. The procedure was designed to provide a control
group  with a similar age and socioeconomic distribution to that of the
cases.

Cases and controls with important perinatal risk factors were excluded from
the study as follows: birthweight<1500g; twins; major malformation or
cerebral palsy; initial hospital stay>15 days. Also excluded were cases and
controls under 7 days, as there were very few diarrhoea deaths in this age
group.

Care was taken to collect a history of the feeding mode both at the time of
death and prior to the onset of illness, to allow for the possibility that
the illness may have resulted in a change in feeding practice. For the controls,
feeding information was collected for the same dates as their matched cases.
